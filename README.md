## Introduction

A fishing tackle shop spends a lot of time manually updating, creating and managing their fishing tackle products. They have requested from me a CLI based application where they can access their stock management system, which is setup using a Google Sheet. This application must be able to update, create and delete products, as well as have additional functionality such as a login/sign up field for security, and the ability to check margins of products.

They estimate that this will half the time they currently spend managing the Google Sheet manually, which frees up resources for them to invest in growing their business both online and in store.
